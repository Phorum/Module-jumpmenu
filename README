Module  : Jumpmenu
Version : 1.2.0
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module adds a menu to the Phorum pages, which can be used to quickly
select a forum to jump to. Forum folders will be shown as submenus.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "jumpmenu" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Jumpmenu".


Customization:
--------------

This module makes use of module templates. If you want to modify the
templates to make them work better for your site's template, then do not
edit the template files that were in the module distribution. Instead,
copy the full directory "mods/jumpmenu/templates/emerald" to
"mods/jumpmenu/templates/yourtemplatename" (asuming that your site's
template is stored as "templates/yourtemplatename") and edit the files
in the new directory. Phorum will automatically recognize that you have
created a specific template set to use for your site's active template.

The available template files are:

- css.tpl           : Code to add to the CSS code for the page.
                      This can be used to add overrides for the default
                      CSS definitions from the file templates/jumpmenu.css.php

- before_footer.tpl : Code that will be loaded in the before_footer hook.
                      This code is used to setup the element with
                      id="mod_jumpmenu_root" (which is the root for the menu)
                      and to run the menu building code.

If you want to create your own root item for the menu, then you can edit
your main Phorum template to include some element that has
id="mod_jumpmenu_root" in its properties. The Jumpmenu module wil
automatically use that one as the root element, for example:

  <a id="mod_jumpmenu_root">
    Open the forum menu ...
  </a>

By default, the orientation of the menus is to the right. If you need the
menus to be oriented to the left, then you can add rel="mod_jumpmenu_left"
to the root element, for example:

  <a id="mod_jumpmenu_root" rel="mod_jumpmenu_left">
    Open the forum menu ...
  </a>
