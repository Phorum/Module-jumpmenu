Changelog for @PACKAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-01-14 v1.2.0

    - Updated the module to make use of jQuery for the javascript code.

    - Fixed various issues that could cause incorrect placement of the
		  jumpmenu menus.

    - Added new German language files by Oliver Riesen.

2009-05-24 v1.1.9

    - Added compatibility for using the jumpmenu within a vroot.

    - Added a German translation by Oliver Riesen and a French
      translation by Manu. Thanks guys!

    - Replaced the CSS :hover classes with scripted highlighting
      code. As a result, we were able to visualize the path that the user
      followed in the jumpmenu, by keeping selected entries in higher
      menu levels active. This behavior matches the behavior that one
      can observe by default in OS menus.

2008-11-08 v1.1.8

    - Fixed the rendering of the popup menu with extra options for
      MSIE. In MSIE, the separator was pushing the menu to full screen
      width, which is not too practical for a menu.

    - Fixed bug: when hovering over the separator, the menu code did
      not detect that the pointer was still on the menu and closed the
      popup menu after a little while.

2008-11-08 v1.1.7

    - Added a hook "jumpmenu_add" to the module, which can be used by
      other modules to add extra items to the root level popup of
      the jump menu. The first implementation of an extra menu item
      has been added to the Recent Messages module.

2008-04-15 v1.1.6

    - Added a module template for the "classic" Phorum template.

2007-12-14 v1.1.5

    - Fixed a problem with the jumpmenu for cases where no forums are
      visible at all for the visitor (for example in case all forums are
      restricted for reading by their permissions).
      Thanks to Steve Healy for reporting the problem.

2007-11-26 v1.1.4

    - Some improvements in the javascript library for positioning the
      menus in case the root node is inside an "absolute" or "relative"
      positioned element (thanks to Matthias for having a site design
      that broke my code and for taking the time to test out a *lot*
      of new test versions to fix that ;-).

2007-11-22 v1.1.3

    - Empty folders are no longer shown in the menu.

    - If hovering over a forum menu item, the submenus below the
      folder in which the forum menu item resides will be collapsed.

    - Fixed some JavaScript errors that occurred when hovering over the
      menu during page unloading.

    - Implemented an <iframe> (yech!) based work around for letting the
      menus cover windowed elements in MSIE (like <select> lists, which
      would otherwise always be on top of the menus).

2007-11-02 v1.1.2

    - Implemented the new css_register and javascript_register hooks
      This requires for Phorum 5.2.2 or newer.

2007-10-23 v1.1.1

    - Added Turkish language file.
      Thanks to Serdar of paticik.com.

2007-10-08 v1.1.0

    - Full rewrite of the old jumpmenu. The jumpmenu now makes use of
      javascript driven menus with submenu's to display folders.
